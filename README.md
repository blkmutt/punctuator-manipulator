punctuator-manipulator
=====================

This is a fork of react-hotloader that uses react-dnd as well in order to drag around commas. No dropping yet, though, just the dragging! One day, react-dnd will 
be used in order to also drop the commas into certain locations!! 

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
